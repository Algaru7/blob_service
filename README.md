## Setting up the Virtual Boxes

To configure the platform we need two virtual boxes with the same Ubuntu version (we used Ubuntu 20.04):

- A master
- A worker

To configure both options with 8 GB RAM and 2 processors we need to follow this process for each virtual box:

- **Settings**->**System**->**Motherboard**-> *Base_Memory= 8192 MB*
- **Settings**->**System**->**Processor**-> *Processor(s)= 2*

After this, we need to update each virtual box to the latest packages.

```shell
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
```
## Setting up the network

We have two options:

- Creating a network for both virtual boxes
- Using a bridged adapter to have connectivity between the virtual boxes and your real machine. 

### Option 1

This option will only allow connectivity between both virtual boxes.

**Steps:**

- Open Virtual Box Manager
- **File**->**Preferences**->**Networks**-> Create a new Network
- You can create any network, we recommend 192.168.10.0/24 for the Network CIDR as it won't interfere with anything.

**Steps for each virtual box**:

- **Settings**->**Network**->**Use NAT Network**-> **Select the previously created NAT Network**.

### Option 2

This is the best option but you need an **ETHERNET Connection**.

**Steps for each virtual box**:

- **Settings**->**Network**->**Use Bridged Adapter**-> **Select enp0s3 as the name**.



## Platform configuration

We have also opted to use a tool called **MicroK8s** as it makes things simpler.

```shell
sudo snap install microk8s --classic
```

Since we use Docker for each microservice we need to install it as well.

```shell
sudo apt install docker.io
```

We need to check if MicroK8s is running on both the worker and the master:

```shell
microk8s status
```

If the service is **NOT** running we start it
```shell
microk8s start
```

Lastly we need to add each other's IP addresses to /etc/hosts so they can communicate with each other:

- vim /etc/hosts
- If master add the IP address of the worker and the name
- If worker add the IP address of the master and the name

### Master Virtual Box

Add the worker node to create a cluster:

```shell
microk8s add-node
```

This will give you an IP address and a hash that you need to copy in the worker virtual box:

Example:

microk8s join 192.168.64.4:25000/IfrgUOBCMGxZyAcRgEXXLONcwMKWpstO

### Worker

We copy the command that the master generated previously.

Previous example:

```shell
microk8s join 192.168.64.4:25000/IfrgUOBCMGxZyAcRgEXXLONcwMKWpstO
```


## Deployment

To deploy, we need two files:

- deploy.sh
- deployment.yml

### If you used bridged adapter

To do this we can use the command *scp*:

```shell
scp <files> <master_name>@<master_IP>:~/
```
- To know the master's virtual box IP you can use the command *ip a*
  
After this we need to give these two files execute permissions using *chmod*:

- chmod +x deploy.sh deployment.yml
  
We then run the deploy:
  

```shell
./deploy.sh
```

### If you created a NAT

First we need to connect the master virtual box with the "outside" world:

- **File**->**Preferences**->**Networks**-> Select Created Network -> Select Port Forwarding

And then add this:

| Name   | Protocol | Host IP | Host Port | Guest IP      | Guest Port |
|--------|----------|---------|-----------|---------------|------------|
| Rule 1 | TCP      | 0.0.0.0 | 2222      | <Master's IP> | 22         |


After this we can use the command *scp*:

```shell
scp -P 2222 <files> <master_name>@localhost:~/
```
  
After this we need to give these two files execute permissions using *chmod*:

- chmod +x deploy.sh deployment.yml
  
We then run the deploy:

```shell
./deploy
